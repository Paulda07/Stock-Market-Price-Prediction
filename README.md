# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
Determining the stock trade information is a vital money-related subject that includes an assumption that the basic data freely accessible within the past has a 
few prescient connections to long-run stock returns. Stock market estimating involves revealing the showcase patterns, arranging speculation strategies, recognizing 
the finest time to buy the stocks and which stocks to buy. Time-series data analysis methods utilize irrefutable data as the premise for assessing future results. 
Time series information can be characterized as numerical information collected in a specific grouping over a period at customary intervals. 
The purpose is to discover in case there's an interface between the information collected so far and in what way does the information change.   
In this project, we performed stock market forecasting using time series analysis with the help of recurrent neural network models(RNNs) and a classical model 
to compare and analyze the accuracy of various models. We implemented long short-term memory(LSTM), Gated recurrent units(GRU) and the classical model
Autoregressive integrated moving average(ARIMA) to predict stock prices. We also aimed to perform risk analysis on each of the stocks we used in the project.
